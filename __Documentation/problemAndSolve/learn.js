/**
  * @NEW_TOPIC <!-- REST & RESTFUL API -->
    REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications.
    It relies on a stateless, client-server communication model and uses standard HTTP methods (GET
    , POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations on resources.
    RESTful API is an API that adheres to the principles of REST, allowing clients to interact with resources
    using standard HTTP methods and URIs. It typically returns data in formats like JSON or XML

    REST -> architectural style for designing networked applications
    RESTful API -> API that adheres to / follows the principles of REST
    -> REST is a set of guidelines for creating APIs that are scalable, stateless, and use standard HTTP methods.


    Transfering data accurately in a network .


    //////// What are HTTP Request and Response structures in UI and REST API 

    //////// What are the top 5 REST guidelines and advantages of them 
    1. Separation of Concerns: REST separates the client and server, allowing them to evolve independently.
    2. Statelessness: Each request from the client to the server must contain all the information needed to understand and process the request, making the server stateless.
    3. Resource-Based: REST focuses on resources, which are identified by URIs. Each resource can be manipulated using standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
    4. Uniform Interface: REST defines a uniform interface for communication between clients and servers, simplifying the architecture.
    5. Cacheability: Responses from the server can be cached to improve performance and reduce server load. 
    6. Layered System: REST allows for a layered architecture, where intermediaries can be introduced to improve scalability
     and security. MVC 


     //////// REST API vs SOAP API 

     architecture : Architecture style vs protocol
      data format : JSON, XML vs XML only
      communication : Stateless vs Stateful
      performance : Lightweight vs Heavyweight
      flexibility : More flexible vs Less flexible
      security : Uses HTTPS vs Uses WS-Security
      standards : Fewer standards vs More standards
      complexity : Simpler vs More complex
      error handling : Uses HTTP status codes vs Uses SOAP faults
      versioning : Versioning through URL or headers vs Versioning through WSDL
      testing : Easier to test with tools like Postman vs More complex testing with SOAP UI

    
      ////// HTTP Methods : are set of actions that can take on a resource .. 

      ////// Put method vs Patch method ...  Complete update vs Partial update
      ////// Concept of Idempotency in RESTFUL API ..  Performing the same operation multiple times should yield the same 
              result without side effects.
              Non Idempotent operations may produce different results or side effects when repeated. (POST method)

  * @NEW_TOPIC <!-- What is CORS in Restful APIs -->

    CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a security feature implemented by web browsers to prevent
    malicious websites from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the web page.
    It allows servers to specify which origins are allowed to access their resources by including specific headers in
    the HTTP response. This is particularly important for RESTful APIs, as they are often accessed
    by web applications hosted on different domains.

    - same domain not restricted
    - different domain restricted - can not share resources 
    - different sub-domain restricted
    - request from http but sender is https - restricted
    - if the port number is different, it is considered a different domain

    7. HMAC Authentication: Uses a hash-based message authentication code to verify the integrity and authenticity of the message.
    8. OpenID Connect: An authentication layer built on top of OAuth 2.0.
    9. SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language): An XML-based standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data between parties.
    10. LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol): A protocol for accessing and managing directory information services.
    12. Certificate-Based Authentication: Uses digital certificates to authenticate users or devices.
    13. Biometric Authentication: Uses unique biological characteristics, such as fingerprints or facial recognition, for authentication.
    14. Single Sign-On (SSO): Allows users to authenticate once and gain access to multiple applications or services.
    15. JSON Web Tokens (JWT): A compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties.
    16. OAuth 2.0: An authorization framework that allows third-party applications to obtain limited access to an HTTP service.

    // JWT is a token-based authentication mechanism that allows users to authenticate and authorize access to resources.
    // JWT consists of three parts: header, payload, and signature.
    // The header contains metadata about the token, such as the algorithm used for signing.
    // The payload contains the claims or data associated with the token, such as user information and
    // expiration time.
    // The signature is used to verify the integrity of the token and ensure that it has not
    // been tampered with. It is created by combining the header and payload, and signing it with a secret key.
    // JWT is commonly used in RESTful APIs for stateless authentication, where the server does not need to store session information.

/**
  * @NEW_TOPIC <!-- Error Handling ? how many ways you can do error handling in node js -->

    Error handling is the process of managing errors that occur during the execution of a program or system 

    4 ways to implement error handling in node js 
    |-> 1. Try-Catch Blocks: Used to catch synchronous errors in code execution.
    |-> 2. Promises and .catch(): Used to handle asynchronous errors in promise
    |-> 3. Async/Await with Try-Catch: Used to handle asynchronous errors in async functions. 
            
            Error first call back (Async )
            ========================
            Error first callback is a convention in Node.js where the first argument of a callback function is reserved for an error object.
            If an error occurs, it is passed as the first argument, and the second argument contains the result.
            This convention allows developers to handle errors in a consistent manner across asynchronous operations.
            

    |-> 4. Error Event Listeners: Used to handle errors emitted by event emit
    |-> 5. Error Middleware in Express: Used to handle errors in Express applications.
    |-> 6. Global Error Handlers: Used to catch unhandled errors in the application.
    |-> 7. Custom Error Classes: Used to create custom error types for better error
    |-> 8. Logging Errors: Used to log errors for debugging and monitoring purposes.
